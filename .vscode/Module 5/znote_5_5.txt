5.5 Notes

Use a list when:
    Data is a natural order to it(minimal changes to order)
    you will need to update or alter the data during the program
    The primary purpost of the data structure is iteration(most likly for loops)

Use a tuple when:
    Data is a natural order to it(minimal changes to order)
    you WILL NOT need to update or alter the data during the program
    The primary purpost of the data structure is iteration(most likly for loops)

Use a dict(dictionary)when:
    the data is unordered, or the order does not matter
    you will need to update or alter the data during the program
    the primary purpose of the data sturcture is looking up values
